<div style="text-align: justify">I lead the Scalable Computing Laboratory (ScaLab) at KTH, Sweden. My research interests revolve around the scalability and efficiency of future computing systems, including computer architecture, system software, and applications. Previously, I was a Computer Scientist at Parallel System Group at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California, USA.</div>

**Current Research Topics**:
+ Heterogeneous computing (e.g., smartNIC, DPU, GPU, RISC-V accelerators).
+ Memory-centric computing (e.g., disaggregated memory, CXL, NVM, heterogeneous memories).
+ Converged HPC and cloud computing (e.g., elasticity, malleability, optimizations).

**Recent Professional Services**:  
+ IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS). Editorial Review Board.<br>

<strong>About me:</strong><br>
My current research revolves around next-generation memory systems in high-performance computing. Disaggregated memory promises to increase the efficiency of cloud data centers by using rack-scale memory pools. We aim to answer questions such as: How can we utilize memory disaggregation in supercomputing enviroments? How will memory disaggregation impact the performance of scientific workloads such as computational physics? What new acceleration techniques are enabled by disaggregated systems?

<strong>About me:</strong><br>
I'm Daniel, a doctoral student at KTH. My field of study is High Performance Computing and, as implied, I deal with a lot of problems in relation to parallel and distributed systems.
I research on technologies that are used in warehouse-scale computers ("datacenters") and could be used in traditional supercomputers on academic settings. Such technologies ranges from the usage of kubernetes and containers to object storage systems. Furthemore, I have strong interests in non-traditional computer architectures and stuff like binary translation/emulation.

<strong>About me:</strong><br>
Bonjour! My research focus on GPU acceleration of scientific applications.  I am also interested in distributed computing, in both HPC clusters and cloud computing environments. My current work aims at enabling the use of novel GPU features to accelerate typical high-performance computing workloads, such as molecular docking applications.
