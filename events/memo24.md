### <a name="Intro"></a>Introduction
The growing disparity between computing speed and memory speed, commonly referred to as the memory wall problem, remains a critical and enduring challenge in the computing community. Recent developments, such as the expansion of the memory hierarchy and the increasingly blurred line between memory and storage, coupled with the introduction of new memory technologies, such as high-bandwidth memory, non-volatile memory, and disaggregated memory, further complicate the situation. The prevalence of heterogeneous computing, ongoing advancements in the memory hierarchy, and the rise of disaggregated architectures significantly broaden the scope of this challenge. Simultaneously, the proliferation of large machine learning (ML) models, graph processing applications, and traditional scientific applications facing bottlenecks due to memory latency, bandwidth, or capacity issues continue to drive researchers, professionals, and practitioners to enhance memory system design and memory management, overcome the constraints imposed by the memory wall, and facilitate high-performance memory-intensive applications.

Computer architecture, operating systems, storage systems, performance models, tools, and applications themselves are being enhanced or even redesigned to address the performance, programmability, and energy efficiency challenges of the increasingly complex and heterogeneous memory systems. Exploring the intersection of these research areas will enable cohesive and synergistic development and collaboration on the future of memory technologies, systems, and applications. Computer architecture and hardware systems, operating systems, storage and file systems, programming stack, performance models and tools are being enhanced, augmented, or even redesigned to address the performance, programmability, and energy efficiency challenges of the increasingly complex and heterogeneous memory systems for HPC and data-intensive applications.

### <a name="topics"></a>Topics of Interest 
This workshop aims to bring together computer science and computational science researchers, from industry, government labs and academia, concerned with the challenges of efficiently using existing and emerging memory systems. The term performance for memory systems is general, which includes latency, bandwidth, power consumption and reliability from the aspect of hardware memory technologies to how it is manifested in the application performance. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

+ Evaluation, characterization, performance analysis, and use cases of emerging memory technologies, including non-volatile memories, high-bandwidth memory, heterogeneous memory, disaggregated memory, etc.

+ Software, hardware, and co-design approaches that ease the adoption and optimize the use of processing-in-memory and near-memory computing technologies.

+ Programming interfaces or language extensions that improve the programmability of using emerging memory technologies and systems, heterogeneous memory system and multi-dimensional data, and unified memory systems.

+ Compiler, runtime, and system techniques for optimizing data layout and placement, page migration, coherence and consistency enforcement, latency hiding and improving bandwidth utilization and energy consumption of heterogeneous memory systems.

+ Enhancement or new development for operating systems, storage and file systems, and I/O system that address challenges of existing and emerging memory technologies, heterogeneous memory systems, and the blurred boundary between memory and storage.

+ Tools, modeling, evaluation, and case study of memory system behavior and application performance that reveals the limitations and characteristics of existing memory systems.

+ Application development and optimization for new memory architecture and technologies and those overcome memory related challenges in their problems.

### <a name="submission"></a>Submission and Review Process
[Submission is Open](https://submissions.supercomputing.org). Login to SC'24 submission site, click 'Make a New Submission', choose MEMO'24. For SC24, IEEE is the SC proceeding publisher. Submissions must use the template of IEEE conference proceedings: two-column, US letter. The minimum number of pages is 5 pages, including references, and there is no upper limit of pages. IEEE will be providing a unique copyright submission site, and access to PDF eXpress to validate final pdfs. Additional guidelines, including the copyright notice for the camera-ready, will be provided at a later time. Camera ready papers are required to be formatted the same as the main conference papers. Each paper is expected to receive a minimum of 3 reviews. Double-blind peer-review will be used. Papers will be evaluated based on novelty, technical soundness, clarity of presentation, and impact. The Technical Program Committee reserves the right to reject incorrectly formatted papers.
