#### 2:05 - 3:00, Expert Panel: Energy-efficient Memory Technology for maximizing bandwidth and reducing latency
#### Overview:
Historically, the performance of many HPC applications has been limited by memory bandwidth and latency. Memory bandwidth has increased at an order of magnitude less per year (on average) versus processor performance. Improving memory latency has proven to be even more challenging. This panel brings together industry leaders involved in the NNSA’s Advanced Memory Technology program, which was conceived to address memory performance by inspiring dramatic memory technology advancements for NNSA applications. The panel will discuss future memory technologies, including trends, challenges, and efforts to rethink and overcome memory system performance hurdles.

#### CXL focus session (4:50 - 5:30) (Moderator: [Stephen Lecler Olivier](https://www.sandia.gov/ccr/staff/stephen-lecler-olivier/))
##### Talk 1: AMAIS — Advanced Memory to Support AI for Science
+ Speaker: [Andres Marquez (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)](https://www.pnnl.gov/people/andres-marquez)
  + Bio: Dr. Marquez is a Chief Scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and a Team Lead for the Future Computing Technologies Group, focusing on Next Gen Architecture Design. He's the manager of PNNL's Advanced Measurement Laboratory and Principal Investigator for the Advanced Memory to Support AI for Science (AMAIS) project, exploring novel system-level memory technologies.
  + Abstract: Multiple technological and economic inflection points are converging to challenge the trajectory of continuous computing growth observed over the past 30 years. Jim Gray's visionary Fourth Paradigm of Data-Intensive Scientific Discovery is now fully manifest in the form of AI-accelerated computing, reshaping the landscape of scientific exploration and computational workloads.
In response to these challenges, the AMAIS (Advanced Memory to support AI for Science) project introduces a heterogeneous, active memory compute paradigm designed to handle and accelerate data-intensive workloads on large memory systems. 
This talk will briefly showcase the machines being deployed. 

##### Talk 2: CXL Shared Memory Case Study: Building a Shared Tier for Lustre Metadata 
+ Speaker: [Jie Ren (William & Mary)](https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/people/ren_jie.php)
  + Bio: Dr. Jie Ren is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at William & Mary. Her research interests include High-Performance Computing, parallel and distributed systems, heterogeneous and composable memory systems, and affordable machine learning systems. Her work aims to improve the accessibility, efficiency, and scalability of modern computing infrastructures.
  + Abstract: Lustre’s metadata path remains a bottleneck: namespace scans inflate tail latency, hot directories serialize, and Distributed Namespace coordination adds extra rounds of work. Compute Express Link (CXL) offers a pooled, byte-addressable memory tier that multiple metadata servers can access via load/store at cache-line granularity. This talk explores a CXL-based shared metadata tier for Lustre that keeps high-leverage metadata warm across servers to shorten lookups, smooth scan tails, and speed restarts, addressing both the I/O wall and the coordination wall while sharing lessons from our early prototype.

### <a name="Intro"></a>Introduction
Recent developments of new memory technologies, such as high-bandwidth memory, non-volatile memory, and disaggregated memory, coupled with advanced high-performance interconnects like CXL and NVlink-c2c, further expand the memory hierarchy and increasingly blur the boundary between memory and storage. The growing disparity between computing speed and memory speed, commonly referred to as the Memory Wall problem, remains a critical and enduring challenge in the computing community. 

The prevalence of heterogeneous computing, ongoing advancements in the memory hierarchy, and the rise of disaggregated architectures significantly broaden the scope of the challenge of efficiently exploiting memory subsystems on large-scale parallel systems. Simultaneously, the proliferation of large machine learning models, graph processing, quantum computer simulations, and traditional scientific applications facing bottlenecks due to memory latency, bandwidth, and capacity constraints, continue to drive researchers, professionals, and practitioners to enhance memory system design and memory management. Computer architecture, operating systems, storage systems, middleware, performance models, tools, and applications are continuously being optimized or even redesigned to address the performance, programmability, and energy efficiency challenges of Memory Wall. Exploring the intersection of these research areas will enable cohesive and synergistic development and collaboration on the future of memory technologies, systems, middleware, and applications. 

This workshop aims to bring together computer science and computational science researchers, from industry, government labs, and academia, concerned with the challenges of efficiently using existing and emerging memory systems. The term performance for memory systems is general, which includes latency, bandwidth, power consumption, and reliability from the aspect of hardware memory technologies to how it is manifested in the application performance.
