## <a name="Intro"></a>Introduction
The growing disparity between CPU speed and memory speed, known as the memory wall problem, has been one of the most critical and long-standing challenges in the computing industry. The situation is further complicated by the recent expansion of the memory hierarchy and the blurred boundary between memory and storage. The memory hierarchy is becoming deeper and more diversified with the adoption of new memory technologies and architectures, including 3D-stacked memory, non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM), memristor, hybrid software and hardware caches, etc. Computer architecture and hardware systems, operating systems, storage and file systems, programming stack, performance models and tools are being enhanced, augmented, or even redesigned to address the performance, programmability, and energy efficiency challenges of the increasingly complex and heterogeneous memory systems for HPC and data-intensive applications.
The MCHPC workshop aims to bring together computer and computational science researchers, from industry, government labs and academia, concerned with the challenges of efficiently using existing and emerging memory systems. The term performance for memory systems is general, which includes latency, bandwidth, power consumption and reliability from the aspect of hardware memory technologies to what it is manifested in the application performance. The topics of interest for the MCHPC workshop include, but are not limited to:
 
* Software, hardware, and co-design approaches that ease the adoption and optimize the use of processing-in-memory and near-memory computing technologies.
* Evaluation, characterization, performance analysis, and use cases of emerging memory technologies, including non-volatile memories, high-bandwidth memory, heterogeneous memory, disaggregated memory, etc.
* Programming interfaces or language extensions that improve the programmability of using emerging memory technologies and systems, heterogeneous memory system and multi-dimensional data, and unified memory systems. 
* Compiler, runtime, and system techniques for optimizing data layout and placement, page migration, coherence and consistency enforcement, latency hiding and improving bandwidth utilization and energy consumption of heterogeneous memory systems. 
* Enhancement or new development for operating systems, storage and file systems, and I/O system that address challenges of existing and emerging memory technologies, heterogeneous memory systems, and the blurred boundary between memory and storage. 
* Tools, modeling, evaluation, and case study of memory system behavior and application performance that reveals the limitation and characteristics of existing memory systems.
* Application development and optimization for new memory architecture and technologies.

### 9:05am - 10:05am	Morning Invited Talk: The Crucial Role of CXL in Future Memory Centric Computing Systems, by Tony Brewer from Micron Technology Inc.
#### Session Chair: Yonghong Yan

**Abstract**: Previous attempts at providing commercial memory centric computing systems have largely
failed due to technologies that did not live up to expectations. The emerging CXL standard is one
of the crucial technologies that will enable commercial memory centric systems in the coming
years. This talk will introduce the CXL standard, how the CXL standard will enable efficient
memory centric computing and some of the market factors shaping current and future versions of
the standard. The HPC community will be able to leverage these high-volume market features to
realize memory centric computing systems that will provide significant improvements in
performance and system energy consumption.

**Bio**: Tony Brewer is currently the chief architect in Micron’s Near Data Computing group. He is the
principal investigator on multiple government contracts and manages a team of architects and
researchers focused on various processing in or near memory style architectures. His career has
been focused on system architecture in both the high-performance computing as well as the
telecommunications industries. Prior to joining Micron in 2015, Tony Brewer was a Co-founder
and Chief Technology Officer for Convey Computer. Former employers include Data General,
Convex Computer, and Hewlett Packard. Tony Brewer received his MS and BS degrees in
Computer Engineering from Purdue University and has over 175 filed patents.

### 11:30am - 12:00pm	Invited Talk: The Path to Memory-Centric Computing in ISO C++, by Christian Trott from Sandia National Laboratories
#### Session Chair: Ron Brightwell
**Abstract**: To make memory-centric compute devices impactful and sustainable for a wide range of customers in HPC and beyond, we need to find ways of leveraging their capabilities in language standards. One of the prime targets for such efforts is the ISO C++ standard, which has been the language of choice for HPC vendors to implement programming models for accelerators, such as CUDA, HIP and SYCL. This talk will discuss existing and upcoming capabilities in the C++ standard like std::mdspan and std::linalg, which enable memory-centric application design. Based on concepts popularized in the Kokkos ecosystem for performance portability, these new features allow the design of algorithms that are memory location and memory layout aware, that leverage advanced memory access capabilities, and that provide customization points to plug special hardware-specific functionality into C++ code without relying on non-standard APIs, such as intrinsics and vendor-specific libraries.

**Bio:** Christian Trott is a high performance computing expert with extensive experience designing and implementing software for modern HPC systems. He is a principal member of staff at Sandia National Laboratories, where he leads the Kokkos core team developing the performance portability programming model for C++ and heads Sandia's delegation to the ISO C++ standards committee. He also serves as adviser to numerous application teams, helping them redesign their codes using Kokkos and achieve performance portability for the next generation of supercomputers. Christian is a regular contributor to numerous scientific software projects including LAMMPS and Trilinos. He earned a doctorate from the University of Technology Ilmenau in theoretical physics with a focus on computational material research.

#### Session Chair: Maya B. Gokhale
**Abstract**: Accelerated in-network computations promise significant
optimizations ranging from data-movement reductions to specialization
opportunities in processing elements. We show updates within the sPIN
(streaming Processing in the Network) network accelerator programming
model - the "CUDA for networking". There, we demonstrate 2x lower
required bandwidth for (sparse) reductions and a highly-optimized packet
processing design based on a low-power RISC-V multi-core architecture.

**Bio**: Torsten is a full Professor of Computer Science at ETH Zürich, Switzerland.  Before joining ETH, he led the performance modeling and simulation efforts of parallel petascale applications for the NSF-funded Blue Waters project at NCSA/UIUC.  He is also a key member of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) Forum where he chairs the "Collective Operations and Topologies" working group.  Torsten won best paper awards at the ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference 2010 (SC10), EuroMPI 2013, SC13, SC14, SC19, IPDPS'15, ACM HPDC'15 and HPDC'16, ACM OOPSLA'16, and other conferences.  He published numerous peer-reviewed scientific conference and journal articles and authored chapters of the MPI-2.2 and MPI-3.0 standards.

### 10:05am - 11:05am	Keynote: The 3rd Wall and the Need for Innovation in Architectures, by Peter Kogge
#### Session Chair: Maya B. Gokhale

**Abstract:** In the past we have seen two major "walls" (memory and power) whose vanquishing required significant advances in architecture. This talk will discuss evidence on the emergence of a new third wall dealing with data locality, which is prevalent in data intensive applications where computation is dominated by memory access & movement – not flops, Such apps exhibit large sets of often persistent data, with little reuse during computation, no predictable regularity, significantly different scaling characteristics, and where streaming is becoming important. Solving such problems will take a new set of innovations in architecture to overcome. In addition to data on the new wall, the talk will introduce one possible technique: the concept of migrating threads, and give evidence of its potential value based on several benchmarks that have shown to have scaling difficulties on conventional architectures..

**Brief Bio:** PETER M. KOGGE is the McCourtney Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, a retired IBM Fellow, and a founder of Emu Solutions, Inc. His research interests are in massively parallel computing paradigms for unconventional applications. He holds over 40 patents and is author of two books.  Prior projects included the IOP - the world’s second multi-threaded parallel processor which flew on every Space Shuttle, EXECUBE - the world's first multi-core processor and first processor on a DRAM chip. His startup, Emu Solutions, has demonstrated the first scalable system that utilizes mobile threads to attack large-scale big data and big graph problems. In 2008, he led DARPA’s Exascale technology study group, which resulted in a widely referenced report on exascale computing. Dr. Kogge has received the Daniel Slotnick best paper award (1994), the IEEE/ACM Seymour Cray award (2012), the IEEE Charles Babbage award (2014), the IEEE Computer Pioneer award (2015), and the Gauss best paper award (2015).

 Prospects for Memory, J. Thomas Pawlowski, [presentation](presentations/MCHPC_Pawlowski_keynote.pdf)

#### Session Chair: Ron Brightwell

**Abstract**:  The outlook for memory components and systems is at the all-time height of excitement. This talk examines the path we have traversed and the likely future directions we must pursue. We will examine scaling across many parameters, "walls" of all sorts concluding with the one that has emerged as the true wall, the dynamics of heterogeneity in systems and their comprising memories, the need for abstraction (still unsatisfied), options available for processing in or nearer to memory, and the imperative technology redirection that is required to make significant strides forward. Time permitting, a lively question and answer period is anticipated.

**Brief Bio**:  J. Thomas Pawlowski is a systems architect and multi-discipline design engineer currently self-employed as a consultant and entrepreneur. He has recently retired from Micron Technology, Inc. where he was employed for 27 years, holding titles including Senior Director, Fellow, Chief Architect and Chief Technologist. He was at the center of numerous new memory architectures, technologies and concepts including synchronous pipelined burst memory, zero bus turnaround memory, double data rate memory, quad data rate memory, reduced latency memory, SerDes memory, multi-channel memory, 3D memory, abstracted memory, smart memory, non-deterministic finite automata (processing in memory technology), processing in interbank memory regions, processing in memory controllers, processing in NAND memory, processing in 3D memory stacks, memory controllers, 3DXpoint memory management, and cryogenic memory among others. Prior to Micron he served for almost 10 years at Allied-Signal Aerspace/Garrett Canada (now Honeywell). In his colorful career Thomas has many design firsts including first FPGAs, microcontrollers and custom microprocessors in aerospace applications, one of the early laptop computer designs (with perhaps the world's first SSD comprising NOR Flash), a novel electronic musical instrument, a line of high-end loudspeakers, and a from-scratch 2-seat electric vehicle design achieving nearly 400mpge efficiency. Thomas holds a BASc degree in electrical engineering from the University of Waterloo and is an IEEE Fellow. Thomas is available for consulting opportunities and would consider employment offers too good to refuse.

<!--, Software and Hardware Support for Programming Heterogeneous Memory
Usability and programmability of complex and heterogeneous memory systems remain significant challenges facing the HPC and data analytics communities. Existing memory systems that include DRAM, SRAM, discrete memory, software unified memory, and distributed memory are difficult to exploit while maintaining portable performance. Approaches include programming language constructs and runtime libraries, OS enhancements, and even hardware mechanisms to enable the competing goals of programmability and portability.

The panel will address challenges and solutions for problems of maintaining portability in applications that must navigate the complex memory hierarchy without sacrificing performance and capability.
